# US Census Data

The United States Census Bureau's first set of once-every-decade statistics shows a country that is growing â€“ but at a slower rate than previously, and with a population that is shifting to the South and West.
The United States Census Bureau is the primary source of statistical data on the population of the United States. Our population data comes from decennial censuses, which count the whole population of the United States every ten years, as well as other surveys.
The information supplied was rather basic, consisting of national and state-level demographic data, as well as information on how these figures effect state representation in Congress. Despite this, it had a few surprises and pointed to several important trends.
For years, growth has slowed, with a particular migration of people from the upstate region north and west of New York City. However, Census Bureau officials announced during a Monday press conference that the state was 89 people shy of avoiding the demographic bullet of losing a congressional seat.
